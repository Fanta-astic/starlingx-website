The article is part of a [blog post series](https://www.starlingx.io/blog/starlingx-deploying-your-app-1/)
that guides you through the various ways of deploying a containerized application on
top of the StarlingX platform. As a reminder, the methods are the following:

- [Plain Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/) methods;
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-install-installing-a-package);
- [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/); and finally
- As a StarlingX Application, which benefits from tight integration with the
  [StarlingX system](https://opendev.org/starlingx/config).

In this article, I will continue demonstrating application deployment options, this time with
focus on [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/), which is a continuous delivery tool that
is used to keep Kubernetes clusters in sync with configuration sources.

In this example, I will be using StarlingX in a virtual All-In-One Simplex (AIO-SX) configuration.
If you want to follow along, you can set up your environment by following
the [Starlingx automated install guide](https://docs.starlingx.io/deploy_install_guides/release/virtual/automated_install.html).


## The Demo App

For consistency, I will use the same application as in the previous post. To learn
more about the demo app, check out the
[demo app repository](https://github.com/bmuniz-daitan/poc-starlingx-messages).


## GitOps and FluxCD

One of the greatest benefits of using FluxCD resources is the possibility to
utilize GitOps methods for your deployments. GitOps is a set of practices, such as version
control, collaboration, compliance and continuous delivery, and apply them to
your infrastructure to achieve a certain level of automation. GitOps uses a Git
repository as single source of truth for all of your configuration options, for both
infrastructure and applications.

FluxCD allows you to use GitOps practices, through a set of tools, to
enable a reliable and automated mechanism of deploying and managing infrastructure
and applications, improving reproducibility and facilitating maintenance and
scalability of your system.

To know more about FluxCD visit the project's [official website](https://fluxcd.io).

## Deploying the Demo App via FluxCD resources

The StarlingX platform provides access to FluxCD resources without direct access
to its CLI, which allow you to easily deploy and manage your
applications. For a list of all available Flux resources,
refer to the [official documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/).

There are many ways of deploying an application using Flux. In this demonstration,
I will deploy the demo app by creating a Source Controller and a Helm Controller.

### Source Controller

The Source Controller is a FluxCD component responsible for providing a common
interface for artifact acquisition.

FluxCD offers 5 types of Source Controllers:

- GitRepository
- OCIRepository
- HelmRepository
- HelmChart
- Bucket

For this demonstration, I will create a GitRepository. Make sure to choose the
best type of source controller for your specific use case.

To create my GitRepository that will contain the Helm Chart, I simply run the
following code:

```shell
~$ cat <<EOF > gitrepository.yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: poc-starlingx
spec:
  interval: 2m
  url: https://github.com/bmuniz-daitan/poc-starlingx-messages.git
  ref:
    branch: main

EOF

~$ kubectl apply -f gitrepository.yaml
```

The command above creates a GitRepository resource called poc-starlingx that
contains the contents of https://github.com/bmuniz-daitan/poc-starlingx-messages.git

```shell
~$ kubectl get gitrepositories

NAME            URL                                                           AGE   READY
poc-starlingx   https://github.com/bmuniz-daitan/poc-starlingx-messages.git   49s   True
```

### Helm Controller

The Helm Controller is an operator that allows the management of Helm Chart
releases in a declarative way. The resource HelmRelease will define the desired
state of a Helm release, and based on actions upon this resource (creation,
deletion or mutation) the controller will perform Helm actions. In this scenario,
before the HelmRelease is created, it will create a resource HelmChart.
The HelmChart is a FluxCD resource responsible for holding the Helm charts with the
specific set of values defined by you.

To deploy the demo app, I execute the following commands:

```shell
~$ cat <<EOF > helmrelease.yaml
apiVersion: "helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1"
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: poc-starlingx
spec:
  releaseName: poc-starlingx
  interval: 2m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: ./helm-chart  # Relative path of the Helm chart inside the repository.
      version: 1.5.2
      sourceRef:
        kind: GitRepository
        name: poc-starlingx
  values: # Override values for the Helm chart
    env:
      - name: MODE
        value: node
      - name: SERVER
        value: 127.0.0.1:8100
      - name: PORT
        value: "8000"

    image:
      tag: latest
      containerPort: 8000

    kube:
      port: 31234
      replicas: 1
      name: poc-starlingx

EOF

~$ kubectl apply -f helmrelease.yaml
```

As mentioned, the `kubectl` command above creates two resources, first, a
HelmChart resource, which is loaded from the GitRepository.

```shell
~$ kubectl get helmcharts

NAME                    CHART          VERSION   SOURCE KIND     SOURCE NAME     AGE     READY   STATUS
default-poc-starlingx   ./helm-chart   1.5.2     GitRepository   poc-starlingx   2m41s   True    packaged 'poc-starlingx' chart with version '1.5.2'

```

After the HelmChart resource is successfully created, it moves on to create the
HelmRelease for the deployment of the application with the values defined in
the helmrelease.yaml file.

```shell
~$ kubectl get helmreleases

NAME            AGE     READY   STATUS
poc-starlingx   3m20s   True    Release reconciliation succeeded
```

With the success of the reconciliation, you can see that the application was
deployed.

```shell
~$ kubectl get all

NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/poc-starlingx-5df9c9947f-7qdss   1/1     Running   0          4m15s

NAME                    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
service/poc-starlingx   NodePort    10.101.7.175   <none>        8100:31234/TCP   4m15s

NAME                            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/poc-starlingx   1/1     1            1           4m15s

NAME                                       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/poc-starlingx-5df9c9947f   1         1         1       4m15s

```

### Modifying the HelmRelease

As I said before, actions upon the HelmRelease resource cause the controller to
perform Helm actions on the deployment. So you can see these type of actions,
let's modify a value on the HelmRelease file and see what happens.

First, I change the value of `replicas` from 1 to 5, this value can be found in
`spec.values.kube.replicas` inside the `helmrelease.yaml` file:

```shell

kube:
  port: 31234
  replicas: 5
  name: poc-starlingx

```

Then I run the `kubectl apply` command again, and wait for the command line to
to show that the HelmRelease resource was configured.

```shell
~$ kubectl apply -f helmrelease.yaml

helmrelease.helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/poc-starlingx configured
```

If you run `kubectl get pods`, you can see that 4 additional pods were created.

```shell
~$ kubectl get pods

NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
poc-starlingx-5df9c9947f-7qdss   1/1     Running   0          29m
poc-starlingx-5df9c9947f-97lqw   1/1     Running   0          17s
poc-starlingx-5df9c9947f-nzh6b   1/1     Running   0          17s
poc-starlingx-5df9c9947f-r2xj9   1/1     Running   0          17s
poc-starlingx-5df9c9947f-rhjjs   1/1     Running   0          17s

```

### Additional resources

In the [FluxCD official documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/), you can find
further resources that Flux provides, which may be better suited for your
specific use case, such as `kustomization`.
This resource is responsible for defining a pipeline
for fetching, decrypting, building, validating and applying kustomize overlays
or plain Kubernetes manifests.

As a summary, FluxCD allows you to deploy your application in many different
ways. It is up to you to evaluate the best resources and how to structure them
so your application can make the most of what FluxCD has to offer.

## Conclusion

You have just learned how to make use of the resources from FluxCD, made
available on the StarlingX platform, to deploy your containerized application.
